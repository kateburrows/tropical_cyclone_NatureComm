Code used for Burrows et al. (submitted to Nature Communications).

This file provides a [sample of the code](code/model.R) used in Burrows et al. (under revision at Nature Communications). This code is intended for transparency and reproducibility and is not able to run.

This project uses health data from the Medicare enrollees dynamic cohort data. These data are publicly available, upon purchase and after an application process, from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) [<https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/CMS-Information-Technology/AccesstoDataApplication/index>].
